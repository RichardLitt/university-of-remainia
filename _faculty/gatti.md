I am presently studying competition and industrial structure in scholarly communications, with a particular focus on open access publication. Previous work has looked at price competition in online markets, and theoretical issues in game theory and search. I am also Director of Studies in Economics - lecturing and supervising undergraduate and graduate students.

Scholarly dissemination is global - the benefits of effective dissemination are not restricted to individual nations, but are global. Therefore policies supporting effective dissemination require coordinated action across national jurisdictions. The EU plays a vital role in facilitating this coordination across national research institutes and funding agencies, and it is essential that UK research and research dissemination policy is coordinated with our EU counterparts.
The best research is highly correlated with the best researchers. So attracting the best available people to work on the most important problems is essential. Any restrictions on movement of researchers necessarily reduces the quality of researchers addressing these issues - and with it the quality of the research undertaken.
Research questions of importance to EU nations are also very likely to be important to the UK as well. But the research itself is applicable to both. This is a classic economic 'externality' - leading to inefficiently low research efforts if national funding predominates. If the best qualified research team to address a specific problem is situated in the UK - it makes little sense that that team is unable to receive funding by EU agencies to undertake that research, but must seek only UK based funding instead.
