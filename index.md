Explore the real stories of UK researchers and why access to European Union programs
matters for the future of UK research.

In a poll before the recent referendum over 83% of academics based in the UK said that 
they wanted the UK to stay within the European Union. Research in the 21st Century
involves more than individuals, it requires teams that spread across national borders,
bringing the best minds to work on the difficult problems facing the world. The UK hosts
much of the world's best research because it is open to the world's best area for the 
training and development for researchers, and the worlds best framework for international
collaboration in research.

The UK's researchers still overwhelmingly support freedom of movement within Europe
and continued involvement with European research programs. As the UK Government 
negotiates the future of our relationship with the European Union we want to tell
the stories of how EU programs have made UK research more effective and more successful
and how this can continue to make a difference for the UK.
