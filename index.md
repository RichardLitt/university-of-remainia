### Because your stories can make a difference

It is the stories of real researchers working in the UK, and the people who support them 
that will make a difference. It is the positive reasons for remaining engaged with the
European Union that we want to talk about.

Any person who is currently working in a UK university, or from industry working with UK 
Universities, who supports freedom of movement and access to European Research programs 
is welcome to apply. We also welcome Postdocs, Students and the full range of supporting 
staff in non-academic roles. After all, it is the whole community of a university in all 
our diversity that is important!
