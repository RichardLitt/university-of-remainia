### What's the problem here?

The vast majority of British researchers are deeply 
concerned that leaving the EU will damage British research and universities severely. In
particular UK researchers want to retain access to European Funding programs and the
great value that freedom of movement creates in making it easier to work with
collaborators and colleagues across Europe.

### So really you're just worried about your money?

Partly yes. Around 14% of the funding for UK research currently comes from EU programs. 
This is an area where the UK punches well above its weight and gets a significant return 
over and above what the UK puts in.

But equally we are concerned about losing the *benefits* that come from freedom of
movement for European researchers. This includes the ability for UK researchers to 
work and live in other European countries as well as European researchers to come here.
But it's also about our ability to easily travel in Europe for meetings, experiments
and visits. 

On this site we're aiming to tell the positive stories about how the EU has contributed
to the UK's ability to do world-leading research that makes a difference.

### Hasn't the UK government already committed to replacing the lost money?

The government has said it will honour those commitments made by the EU prior to an exit, 
up until 2020. As noted in this 
[Scientists4EU post](http://scientistsforeu.uk/2016/08/press-release-philip-hammond-guarantees-eu-funding/) 
this really amounts only to 
honouring EU commitments until we leave (which would likely be around 2020 anyway) and
then making sure that UK researchers can maintain collaborations, but only until 2020.
Bear in mind most of these projects run 2 - 5 years.

UK spending on research has lagged behind our competitors on several measures and the
likely hit to the economy means tax revenues will be down. UK researchers are very
concerned about the medium to long term strength of UK research funding. 

### Why is our research being done by foreigners anyway?

Research is an international activity. Many UK researchers work abroad, both in Europe
and elsewhere, and many UK researchers came here from abroad. More than this researchers
travel regularly to collaborate, use facilities, and discuss results. Freedom of 
movement has attracted many of Europe's best researchers to work in the UK.
